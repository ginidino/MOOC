Exercise70 is about Combining ArrayLists
  * Create the method public static void combine(ArrayList<Integer> first, ArrayList<Integer> second) 
    that inserts the items in a list called second to a list called first. 
    The order of the items can be anything and the same item can appear in the list more than once.
