    Account bartosSwissAccount = new Account("Barto's account in Switzerland",1000000.00);

    System.out.println("Initial state");
    System.out.println(bartosAccount);
    System.out.println(bartosSwissAccount);

    bartosAccount.withdrawal(20);
    System.out.println("Barto's account balance is now: "+bartosAccount.balance());
    bartosSwissAccount.deposit(200);
    System.out.println("Barto's Swiss account balance is now: "+bartosSwissAccount.balance());

    System.out.println("Final state");
    System.out.println(bartosAccount);
    System.out.println(bartosSwissAccount);
