Exercise76 is about Menu and is divided into 3 part
  * In this assignment, we will implement a class Menu that holds information about meals that are available in a cafeteria.
  * Our starting point is the following class skeleton:

    import java.util.ArrayList;

    public class Menu {
        private ArrayList<String> meals;

        public Menu() {
            this.meals = new ArrayList<String>();
        }

        // Implement the methods here
    }
    
  * Menu objects store the information of meals using an object variable of type ArrayList<String>

Exercise 76.1 is about Adding a meal to menu
  * Implement the method public void addMeal(String meal) that adds a new meal to the list this.meals of a Menu object. 
    If the meal is already in the list, it should not be added.

Exercise 76.2 is about Printing the menu
  * Implement the method public void printMeals() that prints the meals in a menu. As an example, the output after three additions could be:

    Hamburger
    Fish'n'Chips
    Sauerkraut

Exercise 76.3 is about Clearing a menu
  * Implement the method public void clearMenu() that clears a menu. After calling this method, the menu should be empty. 
    Class ArrayList has a method that is useful here. Within your method body write meals. and see how NetBeans helps you by showing the available methods.
