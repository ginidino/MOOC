Exercise84 is divided into two parts.

Exercise 84.1 is about Multiple constructors
  Make a class Counter that holds a number that can be decreased and increased. The counter also has an optional check that prevents the counter from going below 0.
  public Counter(int startingValue, boolean check) creates a new counter with the given value. The check is on if the parameter given to check was true.
  public Counter(int startingValue) creates a new counter with the given value. The check on the new counter should be off.
  public Counter(boolean check) creates a new counter with the starting value 0. The check is on if the parameter given to check was true.
  public Counter() creates a new counter with the starting value of 0 and with checking off.
  public int value() returns the current value of the counter
  public void increase() increases the value of the counter by one
  public void decrease() decreases the value of the counter by one, but not below 0 if the check is on
  
Exercise 84.2 is about Alternative methods
  Create also a one parametered versions of the methods increase and decrease:

  public void increase(int increaseAmount) increases the value by the amount of the parameter. If the value of the parameter is negative, the value will not change.
  public void decrease(int decreaseAmount) decreases the value of the counter by the amount given by the parameter, but not below 0 if the check is on. 
  If the value of the parameter is negative, the value of the counter will not change.
