Exercise85 is divided into 3 part

Exercise85.1 is that Weight of a person
  * The reformatory class already has a method skeleton public int weight(Person person)
  * The method gets a person object as a parameter. 
  * The method is supposed to return the weight of the parameter, so the method should call a suitable method of person, get the return value and then return it to the caller.

Exercise85.2 is that Feeding a person
  * the method weight queried some information from the parameter object by calling its method. 
  * It is also possible to change the state of the parameter. 
  * Add to class Reformatory the method public void feed(Person person) that increases the weight of its parameter by one.
  
Exercise 85.3 is that Number of times a weight has been measured
  * Add to class Reformatory the method public int totalWeightsMeasured() that returns the total number of times a weight has been measured.
