Exercise 86 is divided into 4 part
  * In the last set of exercises, we implemented the class LyyraCard. 
    The card had methods for paying economical and gourmet lunches and a method for loading money.
    Last week's version of the card is however somehow problematic. 
    The card knew the lunch prices so that it could take the right price from the balance if a lunch was paid. What if the lunch prices change? 
    Or what if it is decided that LyyraCards could also be used to purchase coffee? 
    A change like these would mean that all the existing LyyraCards should be replaced with the new ones with the right prices and/or new methods. 
    This does not sound good at all!
    A better solution is to store only the balance on the card and have all the inteligence in a cash register.

Exercise 86.1 is that The "stupid" Lyyra card
  * The cash register but let us start by completing the "stupid" version of the Lyyra card. 
  * The card holds the balance and has only two methods, public void loadMoney(double amount) that is already implemented and public boolean pay(double amount)
Exercise 86.2 is that Cash Register and paying with cash
  * In Unicafe, a client pays either with cash or with a Lyyra Card. The personnel uses a cash register to charge the client.
  public class CashRegister {
    private double cashInRegister;   // the amount of cash in the register
    private int economicalSold;      // the amount of economical lunches sold
    private int gourmetSold;         // the amount of gourmet lunches sold

    public CashRegister() {
        // at start the register has 1000 euros
    }

    public double payEconomical(double cashGiven) {
        // the price of the economical lunch is 2.50 euros
        // if the given cash is at least the price of the lunch:
        //    the price of lunch is added to register
        //    the amount of the sold lunches is incremented by one
        //    the method returns cashGiven - lunch price
        // if not enough money is given, all is returned and nothing else happens
    }

    public double payGourmet(double cashGiven) {
        // the price of the gourmet lunch is 4.00 euros
        // if the given cash is at least the price of the lunch:
        //    the price of lunch is added to the register
        //    the amount of the sold lunches is incremented by one
        //    the method returns cashGiven - lunch price
        // if not enough money is given, all is returned and nothing else happens
    }

    public String toString() {
        return "money in register "+cashInRegister+" economical lunches sold: "+economicalSold+" gourmet lunches sold: "+gourmetSold;
    }
}
Exercise 86.3 is that Paying with card
  * Extend the cash register with methods to charge a lunch price from a Lyyra Card
  * Note: card payments do not affect the amount of money in the register!
Exercise 86.4 is that Loading money
  * To complete the assignment, extend the cash register with a method that can be used to load cash to Lyyra Cards. 
  * When a certain amount is loaded to the card, the amount stored in the register increases correspondingly.
