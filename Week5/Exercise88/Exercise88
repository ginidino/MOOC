Exercise88 is about Student
it is divided into 3 part

Exercise 88.1 is that Class Student
  * Implement class Student that holds the following information about a student:
  * name (String)
  * studentNumber (String)
  * The class should have the following methods:

  * A constructor that initializes the name and the student number with the given parameters.
  * getName, that returns the student name
  * getStudentNumber, that returns the student number
  * toString, that returns a String representation of the form: Pekka Mikkola (013141590)
  
Exercise 88.2 is that List of students
  * the program asks for student information from the user until the user gives a student an empty name. After the student info has been enteres, all the students are printed. From each inputted name-studentnumber-pair, the program should create a Student object. The program should store the students in an ArrayList 
  
Exercise 88.3: Search
  * Extend the program of the previous part so that after the student info has been entered and students printed, the user can search the student list based on a given search term.
  * TIP: in the search you should iterate (using for or while) through the student list and by using the method contains of String check if a student's name (obtained with method getName) matches the search term.
