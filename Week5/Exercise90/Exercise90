Exercise90 is divided into 5 part

Exercise 90.1: Class Team
  * Implement a class Team. At this stage team has only a name (String) and the following functionality:

  * a constructor that sets the team name
  * getName, that returns the name

Exercise 90.2: Player
  * Create a class Player with the instance variables for the player name and the amount of goals. 
    A player should have two constructors: one that initializes the name and an another that initializes the name and the amount of goals. 
    Implement also the following methods:

  * getName, returns the player name
  * goals, returns the amount of goals
  * toString, returns a string representation

Exercise 90.3: Adding players to a team
  * Add to the class Team the following methods:

  * addPlayer, adds a player to the team
  * printPlayers, prints the players in the team
  * should store the players to an instance variable of the type ArrayList<Player> within the class Team.

Exercise 90.4: The team maximum size and current size
  * Add to the class Team the methods

  * setMaxSize(int maxSize), sets the maximum number of players that the team can have
  * size, returns the number of players in the team
  * By default the maximum number of players should be set to 16, and that can be changed with the method setMaxSize. 
    Change the method addPlayer so that it does not add players to the team if the team already has the maximum number of players.
 
Exercise 90.5: Goals of a team
  * Add to the class Team the method
  * goals, returns the total number of goals for all the players in the team
