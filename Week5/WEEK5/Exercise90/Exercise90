Exercise 90: Team and Players and is divided into 5 part

Exercise 90.1 is about Class Team
  * Implement a class Team. At this stage team has only a name (String) and the following functionality:
    - a constructor that sets the team name
    - getName, that returns the name
  
  * With the code:

    public class Main {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
        Team barcelona = new Team("FC Barcelona");
        System.out.println("Team: " + barcelona.getName());
        }
    }
  
  * the output should be::
    Team: FC Barcelona
  
Exercise 90.2 is about Player
  * Create a class Player with the instance variables for the player name and the amount of goals. 
    A player should have two constructors: one that initializes the name and an another that initializes the name and the amount of goals. 
    Implement also the following methods:
    - getName, returns the player name
    - goals, returns the amount of goals
    - toString, returns a string representation that is formed as in the example below
  
  * Example usage:

    public class Main {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
        Team barcelona = new Team("FC Barcelona");
        System.out.println("Team: " + barcelona.getName());

            Player brian = new Player("Brian");
            System.out.println("Player: " + brian);

            Player pekka = new Player("Pekka", 39);
            System.out.println("Player: " + pekka);
        }
    }
  
  * and the expected output:
    Team: FC Barcelona
    Player: Brian, goals 0
    Player: Pekka, goals 39
  
Exercise 90.3: Adding players to a team
  * Add to the class Team the following methods:
    - addPlayer, adds a player to the team
    - printPlayers, prints the players in the team

  * You should store the players to an instance variable of the type ArrayList<Player> within the class Team.

  * With the code:

    public class Main {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
        Team barcelona = new Team("FC Barcelona");

            Player brian = new Player("Brian");
            Player pekka = new Player("Pekka", 39);

            barcelona.addPlayer(brian);
            barcelona.addPlayer(pekka);
            barcelona.addPlayer(new Player("Mikael", 1)); // works similarly as the above

            barcelona.printPlayers();
        }
    }
  
  * the output should be:
    Brian, goals 0
    Pekka, goals 39
    Mikael, goals 1
  
Exercise 90.4 is about The team maximum size and current size
  * Add to the class Team the methods
    - setMaxSize(int maxSize), sets the maximum number of players that the team can have
    - size, returns the number of players in the team

  * By default the maximum number of players should be set to 16, and that can be changed with the method setMaxSize. 
    Change the method addPlayer so that it does not add players to the team if the team already has the maximum number of players.

  * With the code:

    public class Main {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
        Team barcelona = new Team("FC Barcelona");
            barcelona.setMaxSize(1);

            Player brian = new Player("Brian");
            Player pekka = new Player("Pekka", 39);
            barcelona.addPlayer(brian);
            barcelona.addPlayer(pekka);
            barcelona.addPlayer(new Player("Mikael", 1)); // works similarly as the above

            System.out.println("Number of players: " + barcelona.size());
        }
    }
  
  * the output should be
    Number of players: 1
  
Exercise 90.5 is about Goals of a team
  * Add to the class Team the method
    - goals, returns the total number of goals for all the players in the team
  
  * With the code:

    public class Main {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            Team barcelona = new Team("FC Barcelona");

            Player brian = new Player("Brian");
            Player pekka = new Player("Pekka", 39);
            barcelona.addPlayer(brian);
            barcelona.addPlayer(pekka);
            barcelona.addPlayer(new Player("Mikael", 1)); // works similarly as the above

            System.out.println("Total goals: " + barcelona.goals());
        }
    }
  
  * the output should be
    Total goals: 40
