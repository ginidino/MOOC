Exercise101 is about The library information system and is divided into 4 part
  * In this assignment we are implementing a simple information system prototype for a library. 
    The prototype will have functionality for searching books by the title, publisher or publishing year.

  * The main building blocks of the system are the classes Book and Library. 
    Objects of the class Book represent the information of a single book. 
    Object of the class Library holds a set of books and provides various ways to search for the books within the library.

Exercise 101.1 is about Book
  * Let us start with the class Book. The class has instance variables title for the book title, publisher for the name of the publisher, 
    and year for the publishing year. The title and the publisher are of the type String and the publishing year is represented as an integer.
  * Now implement the class Book. The class should have the constructor 
    - public Book(String title, String publisher, int year) 
    methods 
    - public String title(), public String publisher(), public int year() and public String toString().

* Example usage:
  Book cheese = new Book("Cheese Problems Solved", "Woodhead Publishing", 2007);
  System.out.println(cheese.title());
  System.out.println(cheese.publisher());
  System.out.println(cheese.year());
  System.out.println(cheese);

  * The output:
    Cheese Problems Solved
    Woodhead Publishing
    2007
    Cheese Problems Solved, Woodhead Publishing, 2007


Exercise 101.2 is about Library
  * Implement the class Library, with constructor public Library() and methods public void addBook(Book newBook) and public void printBooks()
  
  * code:
    Library Library = new Library();
    Book cheese = new Book("Cheese Problems Solved", "Woodhead Publishing", 2007);
    Library.addBook(cheese);
    Book nhl = new Book("NHL Hockey", "Stanley Kupp", 1952);
    Library.addBook(nhl);
    Library.addBook(new Book("Battle Axes", "Tom A. Hawk", 1851));
    Library.printBooks();
  
  * The output
    Cheese Problems Solved, Woodhead Publishing, 2007
    NHL Hockey, Stanley Kupp, 1952
    Battle Axes, Tom A. Hawk, 1851

Exercise 101.3 is about Search functionality
  * Add to the class Library the methods 
    - public ArrayList<Book> searchByTitle(String title) 
    - public ArrayList<Book> searchByPublisher(String publisher) 
    - public ArrayList<Book> searchByYear(int year). 
    The methods return the list of books that match the given title, publisher or year.
  * Note: you are supposed to do a method that returns an ArrayList.
  * code:
    public class Library {
      // ...

      public ArrayList<Book> searchByTitle(String title) {
        ArrayList<Book> found = new ArrayList<Book>();

        // iterate the list of books and add all the matching books to the list found

        return found;
    }
   
  * Note: when you do the search by a string (title or publisher), 
           do not look for exact matches (with the method equals) instead use the method contains of the class String.
   
  * code:
     Library Library = new Library();
     Library.addBook(new Book("Cheese Problems Solved", "Woodhead Publishing", 2007));
     Library.addBook(new Book("The Stinky Cheese Man and Other Fairly Stupid Tales", "Penguin Group", 1992));
     Library.addBook(new Book("NHL Hockey", "Stanley Kupp", 1952));
     Library.addBook(new Book("Battle Axes", "Tom A. Hawk", 1851));

     ArrayList<Book> result = Library.searchByTitle("Cheese");
     for (Book book: result) {
         System.out.println(book);
     }

     System.out.println("---");
     for (Book book: Library.searchByPublisher("Penguin Group  ")) {
         System.out.println(book);
     }

     System.out.println("---");
     for (Book book: Library.searchByYear(1851)) {
         System.out.println(book);
     }
  * The output:
    Cheese Problems Solved, Woodhead Publishing, 2007
    The Stinky Cheese Man and Other Fairly Stupid Tales, Penguin Group, 1992
    ---
    ---
    Battle Axes, Tom A. Hawk, 1851

Exercise 101.4 is about Improved search
  * There are some minor problems with the implemented search functionality. 
    - One particular problem is that the search differentiates upper and lower case letters. 
      In the above example the search by title with the search term "cheese" produced an empty list as answer. 
      The example where the search term contained extra white spaces did not give the expected answer, either. 
      We'd like the search functionality to be case insensitive and not disturbed by the extra white spaces at the start or at the end of the search terms.
      We will implement a small helper library StringUtils that will then be used in the Library for the more flexible search functionality.
  
  * Implement the class StringUtils with a static method public static boolean included(String word, String searched), 
    which checks if the string searched is contained within the string word. As described in the previous paragraph, 
    the method should be case insensitive and should not care about trailing and ending white spaces in the string searched. 
    If either of the strings is null, the method should return false.
 
 * Tip: The methods trim and toUpperCase() of the class String might be helpful.
 
 * When you have completed the method, use it in the search functionality of the class Library.
 
 * Use the method as follows:

   if(StringUtils.included(book.title(), searchedTitle)) {
      // Book found!
   }
 * The improved library with the example:

   Library Library = new Library();
   Library.addBook(new Book("Cheese Problems Solved", "Woodhead Publishing", 2007));
   Library.addBook(new Book("The Stinky Cheese Man and Other Fairly Stupid Tales", "Penguin Group", 1992));
   Library.addBook(new Book("NHL Hockey", "Stanley Kupp", 1952));
   Library.addBook(new Book("Battle Axes", "Tom A. Hawk", 1851));

   for (Book book: Library.searchByTitle("CHEESE")) {
       System.out.println(book);
   }

   System.out.println("---");
   for (Book book: Library.searchByPublisher("PENGUIN  ")) {
      System.out.println(book);
   }
   
 * output
   Cheese Problems Solved, Woodhead Publishing, 2007
   The Stinky Cheese Man and Other Fairly Stupid Tales, Penguin Group, 1992
   ---
   The Stinky Cheese Man and Other Fairly Stupid Tales, Penguin Group, 1992
